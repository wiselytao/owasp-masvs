- **硬編碼密鑰(Hardcoded keys)** – Cryptographic keys which are stored in the device itself.
- **行程間通訊(IPC)** – Inter Process Communications,In IPC Processes communicate with each other and with the kernel to coordinate their activities.
- **輸入驗證(Input Validation)** – The canonicalization and validation of untrusted user input.
- **JAVA位元組碼(JAVA Bytecode)** - Java bytecode is the instruction set of the Java virtual machine(JVM). Each bytecode is composed of one, or in some cases two bytes that represent the instruction (opcode), along with zero or more bytes for passing parameters.
- **惡意程式碼(Malicious Code)** – Code introduced into an application during its development unbeknownst to the application owner, which circumvents the application's intended security policy. Not the same as malware such as a virus or worm!
- **惡意軟體(Malware)** – Executable code that is introduced into an application during runtime without the knowledge of the application user or administrator.
- **開放網站應用程式安全計畫(Open Web Application Security Project, OWASP)** – The Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a worldwide free and open community focused on improving the security of application software. Our mission is to make application security "visible," so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about application security risks. See: http://www.owasp.org/
- **個人識別資訊(Personally Identifiable Information, PII)** - is information that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context.
- **地址無關可執行文件(PIE)** – Position-independent executable (PIE) is a body of machine code that, being placed somewhere in the primary memory, executes properly regardless of its absolute address.
- **公開金鑰基礎建設(PKI)** – A PKI is an arrangement that binds public keys with respective identities of entities. The binding is established through a process of registration and issuance of certificates at and by a certificate authority (CA).
- **靜態應用程式安全測試(SAST)** – Static application security testing (SAST) is a set of technologies designed to analyze application source code, byte code and binaries for coding and design conditions that are indicative of security vulnerabilities. SAST solutions analyze an application from the “inside out” in a nonrunning state.
- **系統開發生命週期(SDLC)** – Software development lifecycle.
- **安全架構(Security Architecture)** – An abstraction of an application's design that identifies and describes where and how security controls are used, and also identifies and describes the location and sensitivity of both user and application data.
- **安全配置(Security Configuration)** – The runtime configuration of an application that affects how security controls are used.
- **安全控制措施(Security Control)** – A function or component that performs a security check (e.g. an access control check) or when called results in a security effect (e.g. generating an audit record).
- **SQL注入(SQL Injection, SQLi)** – A code injection technique used to attack data driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry point.
- **單一簽入身分驗證(SSO Authentication)** – Single Sign On(SSO) occurs when a user logs in to one Client and is then signed in to other Clients automatically, regardless of the platform, technology, or domain the user is using. For example when you log in in google you automatically login in the youtube , docs and mail service.
- **威脅建模(Threat Modeling)** - A technique consisting of developing increasingly refined security architectures to identify threat agents, security zones, security controls, and important technical and business assets.
- **傳輸層安全性協定(Transport Layer Security, TLS)** – Cryptographic protocols that provide communication security over the Internet
- **統一資源識別符/統一資源標示(URI/URL/URL fragments)** – A Uniform Resource Identifier is a string of characters used to identify a name or a web resource. A Uniform Resource Locator is often used as a reference to a resource.
- **用戶驗收測試(User acceptance testing, UAT)**– Traditionally a test environment that behaves like the production environment where all software testing is performed before going live.
